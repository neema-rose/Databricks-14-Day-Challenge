# Day 1 – PySpark DataFrame Basics

This folder contains my work for **Day 1** of the Databricks 14-Day Challenge by Indian Data Club.

The goal of Day 1 was to understand how **Spark DataFrames** work inside Databricks using simple PySpark operations.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to:
- Create a Spark DataFrame
- Display data
- Filter rows using conditions

---

## 🛠 What I did

Using PySpark inside Databricks:

- Created a DataFrame with product names and prices
- Displayed the full dataset
- Filtered and displayed only expensive products (price > 1000)

This demonstrates how Spark performs basic data operations on distributed data.
